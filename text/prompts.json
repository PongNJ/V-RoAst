What is considered divided and undivided depends on the median type and its length:\n- Divided carriageways are those that physically separate opposing traffic flows by either a barrier or a wide physical median consistently and for a distance of 400m or more.\n- An undivided carriageway has no physical separation between opposing traffic flows, or physically separates traffic for a section of less than 400m.\n- One-way roads must be coded as undivided and the Median type set to one-way.\n- Service roads must be coded separately to the main carriageways. Code service roads the same way as standard roads.\n- If a bus or transit lane is part of the main carriageway, code it as part of the carriageway (see instructions on coding transit lanes under Number of lanes). Where there is a dedicated, separated carriageway for buses, these should be coded as divided or undivided carriageways separate to the main carriageway",

Warning or directional signs are placed well ahead of points of interest (e.g. an intersection or rail crossing) or hazard to give drivers adequate warning. This may mean that the sign warning of a hazard is in a different coding segment. The distance is generally determined by the traffic speed. The specifications will vary from country to country, however, as a general guide:\n\u2022 Less than 30km/h (20mph): At location\n\u2022 30km/h - 50km/h (20mph - 30mph): 5m - 75m\n\u2022 50km/h - 80km/h (30mph - 50mph): 50m - 200m\n\u2022 80km/h -100km/h (50mph - 60mph): 150m - 250m >100km/h (>60mph): 200m - 400m\nFor urban road assessments, curbs and channelization may be considered in place of edge lines where vehicle parking, paved shoulder or on road bicycle or motorcycle lanes are not present.\nDelineation, particularly the presence and quality of reflective signs and markers, is important for safety at night.\n\u2018Poor\u2019 or \u2018adequate\u2019 delineation should be consistent with that recorded as part of quality of curve, intersections and pedestrian crossings.",
